      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p>
        Music is an art form through which the act of expressing enhances
        emotions. The development of skills in composing, performing and
        listening sees students at Soutgate participate in activities that
        help express the intellect and imagination.

      <p>
        Southgate offers detailed programs in music. The three main avenues of
        music education at Southgate are classroom, extended tuition and
        co-curricular that progress through both the Junior and Senior Schools.
        These avenues are open to all students and structured to meet their
        developmental needs, be that beginner or virtuoso.

        Classroom programs are part of every student’s curriculum from Pre K to
        Year 8. Our extended tuition (instrumental or musicianship) program
        offers individual instrumental lessons conducted by some of Sydney’s
        leading instrumentalists and performers during the school day. Lessons
        are offered for a wide variety of instruments, with most instruments
        also available for hire from the school.
