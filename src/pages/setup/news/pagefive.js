            Our group helped run a concert showcasing Years 10-12 students from
            St Edmunds College Wahroonga. St Edmunds College is a high school
            for students with varying intellectual disabilities, neurodivergent
            minds and those with sensory impairments. This 15-year partnership
            between Year 10 Abbotsleigh girls and senior St Edmund’s is a much
            loved and valued tradition.
          </p>

            The St Edmund’s (Eddies) concert is always a night of fun. Singing,
            dancing, acting and music are well-tested methods of uniting people
            with different experiences and circumstances. This year’s concert
            was no exception. The students of St Edmunds elected the theme
            ‘Eddies Goes to the Movies’ and picked songs and dances to match.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Bellingen Shire has a relatively low socio-economic index… many
            people are employed in part-time work, juggling childcare and work,
            and many rely in part or altogether on Centrelink benefits,” Linda
            explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some talented St Edmunds students volunteered for soloist singing
            spots, showcasing their amazing voices. Anthony, Anant and Angelica
            gave the audience goose bumps with their outstanding performances..”

            St Lucy’s School is a K-7 Catholic school in Wahroonga for students
            with disabilities. It provides excellence in education that empowers
            students with the values, knowledge, attitudes and skills to
            flourish and participate fully in society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the week our group participated in multiple activities
            such as classroom work and sporting activities. We discovered that
            classrooms at St Lucy’s function differently as they cater for the
            individual needs for every student. As there was a significant
            communication barrier when interacting with the children, we learned
            simple sign language to facilitate communication. We are all so
            grateful for having experienced this memorable week.

            Our group had the privilege of working with the Cerebral Palsy
            Alliance, a non-profit organisation operating across NSW that helps
            people living with neurological and physical disabilities achieve
            their goals and lead the most comfortable, independent and inclusive
            lives possible. We learnt about their work running a multitude of
            programs and services catering not only for those with cerebral
            palsy but also for other conditions such as autism, muscular
            dystrophy, acquired brain injuries and stroke to support maximum
            participation in the community. Specifically, our group helped the
            CPA run their boccia games and trainings as part of their sports
            program. Boccia is a game designed with physical constraints that
            mean players must be seated, allowing those with physical
            disabilities the chance to compete in an accessible sport at an
            elite level.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the start of the week, we were introduced to Peter King, our
            supervisor, who helped familiarise us with the rules and classes of
            boccia. BC1 players are chair-bound but can throw boccia balls by
            hand, and BC3 players relied on ramps to roll the balls. On Tuesday
            we played training games with Scott Elsworth, captain of the
            Australian team and defending national champion.
          </p>
          <p>
            We did a tour of the CPA facilities, visiting the numerous therapy
            areas, sporting centre, offices, residences and the hydrotherapy
            pool. On Wednesday, our group helped with refereeing and timekeeping
            of BC2, BC3 and mixed games in the Sydney Summer Singles Boccia
            Competition. On Thursday, we played with the Australian
            representative team, who would be competing internationally in Dubai
            in several weeks and naturally, far outmatched our group. The day
            was rewarding not only in playing the game but getting to know the
            players and being inspired by their journeys to becoming elite
            players. On Friday, we were referees and timekeepers and experienced
            what it was like to play as a BC3 player using ramps to finish our
            week.
          </p>
          <p>
            We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, not only getting to know so
            many of the wonderfully quirky, intelligent and kind athletes and
            staff, but also learning so much about what it is like to live with
            a disability and how empowering sport can be. Sports such as boccia
            allow people to use their disabilities to excel in their specialised
            field further than a ‘normal’ person, as was proven to us time and
            time again.

            The New Horizons ALE program was conducted for the first time this
            year. New Horizons is a not-for-profit organisation run in a
            corporate style. The first activity of the week involved working
            with different departments in the head office of the organisation,
            for example: Finance, Enterprise Risk and Governance, People and
            Culture, and Assets and Facility Management. Some girls even had the
            opportunity to talk to the CEO of the organisation. A branch of New
            Horizons is located in Thornleigh, which serves as a respite centre
            where people with additional needs can interact with other members
            of the community. We spent the day with the customers, talking to
            them and playing serious games of Jenga.

            The Aged Care centre is located on site at North Ryde with
            approximately 78 clients. We learnt about their daily schedules and
            even played some of the brain-stimulating activities such as the
            Alphabet Game and Trivia. We also worked with a part of the
            organisation called Orana, where carers were available for
            one-on-one personal assistance for their customers. Many of these
            carers see about 15 customers on a weekly basis. We met with some of
            the customers at their weekly craft session, to partake in creating
            Christmas decorations and talking to them about their lives. We
            learnt about the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the
            effects brought about by changes to funding. To finish off the week,
            we spent time in the New Horizons Packable factory, where many of
            the organisation’s customers are given the opportunity to join the
            workforce. We helped them package products for companies such as
            Canon, while making many new friends along the way.

            During our ALE week we visited Operation Christmas Child (OCC), The
            Ponds Anglicare Retirement Village and helped with the preparations
            for the ABBOX of FUN summer camp. At OCC, we organised and packed
            shoeboxes, which were delivered by families from all parts of
            Australia. These boxes will be distributed to less fortunate
            children overseas. Our job was to help sort out the boxes and ensure
            that they were well packed to bring joy into the children’s lives.
            This experience was so special, as we were the last ones to see the
            box before a child overseas opens the box, which will bring so much
            happiness to them.

            At the Anglicare Retirement Village, we spent time with the
            residents in various activities and celebrated the residents who had
            birthdays in November, and really enjoyed listening to their
            stories. Many of the elderly residents had lost cognitive abilities,
            so we were honoured to have had the opportunity to spread a little
            happiness during the season of giving and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            The activities the week showed us that in the race of life, many
            people have a head start, or are already behind, due to
            circumstances beyond their control and helped us realise how it is
            our responsibility to assist those who are less fortunate.
